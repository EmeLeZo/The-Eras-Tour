                            Salt air, and the rust on your door<br>
                            I never needed anything more<br>
                            Whispers of "Are you sure?"<br>
                            "Never have I ever before"<br>
                            <br>
                            But I can see us lost in the memory<br>
                            August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
                            'Cause it was never mine<br>
                            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
                            August sipped away like a bottle of wine<br>
                            'Cause you were never mine<br>
                            <br>
                            Your back beneath the sun<br>
                            Wishin' I could write my name on it<br>
                            Will you call when you're back at school?<br>
                            I remember thinkin' I had you<br>
                            <br>
                            But I can see us lost in the memory<br>
                            August slipped away into a moment in time<br>

                            <br>
                            Back when we were still changin' for the better<br>
                            Wanting was enough<br>
                            For me, it was enough<br>
                            To live for the hope of it all<br>
                            Cancel plans just in case you'd call<br>
                            And say, "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
                            So much for summer love and saying "us"<br>
                            'Cause you weren't mine to lose<br>
                            You weren't mine to lose, no<br>
                            <br>

                            'Cause you were never mine, never mine<br>
                            <br>
                            But do you remember?<br>
                            Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"<br>
                            And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?<br>
