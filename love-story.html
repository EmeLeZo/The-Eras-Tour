                            We were both young when I first saw you<br>
                            I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
                            I'm standing there<br>
                            On a balcony, in summer air<br>
                            <br>
                            See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
                            See you make your way through the crowd<br>
                            And say, "Hello"<br>
                            Little did I know<br>
                            <br>
                            That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
                            And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
                            And I was crying on the staircase<br>
                            Begging you, "Please don't go"<br>
                            And I said<br>
                            <br>
                            "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
                            I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
                            You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
                            It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br>
                            <br>
                            So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
                            We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
                            So close your eyes<br>
                            Escape this town for a little while, oh-oh<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter<br>
                            And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
                            But you were everything to me<br>
                            I was begging you, "Please don't go"<br>
                            And I said<br>
                            <br>
                            "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
                            I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
                            You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
                            It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br>
                            <br>
                            Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel<br>
                            This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
                            Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
                            It's a love story, baby, just say yes, oh-oh<br>
                            <br>
                            I got tired of waiting<br>
                            Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>
                            My faith in you was fading<br>
                            When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>
                            And I said<br>
                            <br>
                            "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
                            I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
                            Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"<br>
                            He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring<br>
                            And said<br>
                            <br>
                            "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone<br>
                            I love you, and that's all I really know<br>
                            I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
                            It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br>
                            <br>
                            Oh, oh, oh<br>
                            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
