                            You booked the night train for a reason<br>
                            So you could sit there in this hurt<br>
                            <br>
                            Bustling crowds or silent sleepers<br>
                            You're not sure which is worse<br>
                            <br>
                            Because I dropped your hand while dancing<br>
                            Left you out there standing<br>
                            Crestfallen on the landing<br>
                            Champagne problems<br>
                            <br>
                            Your mom's ring in your pocket<br>
                            My picture in your wallet<br>
                            Your heart was glass, I dropped it<br>
                            Champagne problems<br>
                            <br>
                            You told your family for a reason<br>
                            You couldn't keep it in<br>
                            Your sister splashed out on the bottle<br>
                            Now no one's celebrating<br>
                            <br>
                            Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it<br>
                            No crowd of friends applauded<br>
                            Your hometown skeptics called it<br>
                            Champagne problems<br>
                            <br>
                            You had a speech, you're speechless<br>
                            Love slipped beyond your reaches<br>
                            And I couldn't give a reason<br>
                            Champagne problems<br>
                            <br>
                            Your Midas touch on the Chevy door<br>
                            November flush and your flannel cure<br>
                            "This dorm was once a madhouse"<br>
                            I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"<br>
                            <br>
                            How evergreen, our group of friends<br>
                            Don't think we'll say that word again<br>
                            And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls<br>
                            That we once walked through<br>
                            <br>
                            One for the money, two for the show<br>
                            I never was ready, so I watch you go<br>
                            Sometimes you just don't know the answer<br>
                            'Til someone's on their knees and asks you<br>
                            <br>
                            "She would've made such a lovely bride<br>
                            What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said<br>
                            But you'll find the real thing instead<br>
                            She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred<br>
                            <br>
                            And hold your hand while dancing<br>
                            Never leave you standing<br>
                            Crestfallen on the landing<br>
                            With champagne problems<br>
                            <br>
                            Your mom's ring in your pocket<br>
                            Her picture in your wallet<br>
                            You won't remember all my<br>
                            Champagne problems<br>
