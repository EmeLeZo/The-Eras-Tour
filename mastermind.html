                            Once upon a time<br>
                            The planets and the fates and all the stars aligned<br>
                            You and I ended up in the same room at the same time<br>
                            <br>
                            And the touch of a hand lit the fuse<br>
                            Of a chain reaction of countermoves<br>
                            To assess the equation of you<br>
                            Checkmate, I couldn't lose<br>
                            <br>
                            What if I told you none of it was accidental?<br>
                            And the first night that you saw me<br>
                            Nothing was gonna stop me<br>
                            I laid the groundwork, and then just like clockwork<br>
                            The dominoes cascaded in a line<br>
                            What if I told you I'm a mastermind?<br>
                            And now you're mine<br>
                            It was all by design<br>
                            'Cause I'm a mastermind<br>
                            <br>
                            You see, all the wisest women had to do it this way<br>
                            'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game<br>
                            <br>
                            If you fail to plan, you plan to fail<br>
                            Strategy sets the scene for the tale<br>
                            I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails<br>
                            And the liquor in our cocktails<br>
                            <br>
                            What if I told you none of it was accidental?<br>
                            And the first night that you saw me I knew I wanted your body<br>
                            I laid the groundwork, and then just like clockwork<br>
                            The dominoes cascaded in a line<br>
                            What if I told you I'm a mastermind?<br>
                            And now you're mine<br>
                            It was all my design<br>
                            'Cause I'm a mastermind<br>
                            <br>
                            No one wanted to play with me as a little kid<br>
                            So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since<br>
                            To make them love me and make it seem effortless<br>
                            This is the first time I've felt the need to confess<br>
                            And I swear<br>
                            I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care<br>
                            <br>
                            So I told you none of it was accidental?<br>
                            And the first night that you saw me<br>
                            Nothing was gonna stop me<br>
                            I laid the groundwork, and then saw a wide smirk<br>
                            On your face, you knew the entire time<br>
                            You knew that I'm a mastermind<br>
                            And now you're mine<br>
                            Yeah, all you did was smile<br>
                            'Cause I'm a mastermind
