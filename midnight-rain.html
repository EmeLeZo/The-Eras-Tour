                            Rain, he wanted it comfortable<br>
                            I wanted that pain<br>
                            He wanted a bride<br>
                            I was making my own name<br>
                            Chasing that fame<br>
                            He stayed the same<br>
                            All of me changed like midnight<br>
                            <br>
                            My town was a wasteland<br>
                            Full of cages, full of fences<br>
                            Pageant queens and big pretenders<br>
                            But for some, it was paradise<br>
                            <br>
                            My boy was a montage<br>
                            A slow-motion, love potion<br>
                            Jumping off things in the ocean<br>
                            I broke his heart 'cause he was nice<br>
                            <br>
                            He was sunshine, I was midnight rain<br>
                            He wanted it comfortable<br>
                            I wanted that pain<br>
                            He wanted a bride<br>
                            I was making my own name<br>
                            Chasing that fame<br>
                            He stayed the same<br>
                            All of me changed like midnight<br>
                            <br>
                            It came like a postcard<br>
                            Picture perfect, shiny family<br>
                            Holiday, peppermint candy<br>
                            But for him it's every day<br>
                            <br>
                            So I peered through a window<br>
                            A deep portal, time travel<br>
                            All the love we unravel<br>
                            And the life I gave away<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause he was sunshine<br>
                            I was midnight rain<br>
                            He wanted it comfortable<br>
                            I wanted that pain<br>
                            He wanted a bride<br>
                            I was making my own name<br>
                            Chasing that fame<br>
                            He stayed the same<br>
                            All of me changed<br>
                            Like midnight<br>
                            <br>
                            Rain, he wanted it comfortable<br>
                            I wanted that pain<br>
                            He wanted a bride<br>
                            I was making my own name<br>
                            Chasing that fame<br>
                            He stayed the same<br>
                            All of me changed<br>
                            Like midnight<br>
                            <br>
                            I guess sometimes we all get<br>
                            Just what we wanted, just what we wanted<br>
                            And he never thinks of me<br>
                            Except when I'm on TV<br>
                            <br>
                            I guess sometimes we all get<br>
                            Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted<br>
                            And I never think of him<br>
                            Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)
