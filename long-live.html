                            I said remember this moment in the back of my mind<br>
                            The time we stood with our shaking hands<br>
                            The crowds in stands went wild<br>
                            We were the Kings and the Queens<br>
                            <br>
                            And they read off our names<br>
                            The night you danced like you knew our lives<br>
                            Would never be the same<br>
                            <br>
                            You held your head like a hero<br>
                            <br>
                            On a history book page<br>
                            It was the end of a decade<br>
                            But the start of an age<br>
                            <br>
                            Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
                            All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
                            I was screaming long live all the magic we made<br>
                            <br>
                            And bring on all the pretenders<br>
                            <br>
                            One day, we will be remembered<br>
                            <br>
                            I said remember this feeling<br>
                            I passed the pictures around<br>
                            Of all the years that we stood there<br>
                            On the sidelines wishing for right now<br>
                            <br>
                            We are the Kings and the Queens<br>
                            You traded your baseball cap for a crown<br>
                            When they gave us our trophies<br>
                            And we held them up for our town<br>
                            <br>
                            And The Cynics were outraged<br>
                            Screaming, "This is absurd!"<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans<br>
                            <br>
                            Got to rule the world<br>
                            <br>
                            Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
                            All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
                            <br>
                            I was screaming long live all the magic we made<br>
                            And bring on all the pretenders<br>
                            I'm not afraid<br>
                            Long live all the mountains we moved<br>
                            <br>
                            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
                            <br>
                            I was screaming long live that look on your face<br>
                            And bring on all the pretenders<br>
                            <br>
                            One day, we will be remembered<br>
                            <br>
                            Hold on to spinning around<br>
                            <br>
                            Confetti falls to the ground<br>
                            May these memories break our fall<br>
                            <br>
                            Will you take a moment<br>
                            Promise me this<br>
                            That you'll stand by me forever<br>
                            But if â€”God forbidâ€” fate should step in<br>
                            <br>
                            And force us into a goodbye<br>
                            If you have children some day<br>
                            When they point to the pictures<br>
                            Please tell 'em my name<br>
                            Tell 'em how the crowds went wild<br>
                            Tell 'em how I hope they shine<br>
                            <br>
                            Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
                            I had the time of my life, with you<br>
                            Long, long live the walls we crashed through<br>
                            All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
                            And I was screaming long live all the magic we made<br>
                            And bring on all the pretenders<br>
                            I'm not afraid<br>
                            Singing, long live all the mountains we moved<br>
                            I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
                            And long, long live that look on your face<br>
                            And bring on all the pretenders<br>
                            One day, we will be remembered
