                            Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago<br>
                            I was in your sights, you got me alone<br>
                            You found me, you found me, you found me, e-e-e-e<br>
                            I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that<br>
                            And when I fell hard, you took a step back<br>
                            Without me, without me, without me, e-e-e-e<br>
                            <br>
                            And he's long gone when he's next to me<br>
                            And I realize the blame is on me<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            So shame on me now<br>
                            Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
                            'Til you put me down, oh<br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            So shame on me now<br>
                            Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
                            Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
                            Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            <br>
                            No apologies, he'll never see you cry<br>
                            Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why<br>
                            You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning, i-i-i-ing<br>
                            Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street<br>
                            A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be<br>
                            And now I see, now I see, now I see, e-e-e-e<br>
                            <br>
                            He was long gone when he met me<br>
                            And I realize the joke is on me, hey!<br>
                            <br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            So shame on me now<br>
                            Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
                            'Til you put me down, oh<br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            So shame on me now<br>
                            Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
                            Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
                            Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            <br>
                            And the saddest fear<br>
                            Comes creeping in<br>
                            That you never loved me<br>
                            Or her, or anyone, or anything<br>
                            Yeah!<br>
                            <br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            So shame on me now<br>
                            Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)<br>
                            'Til you put me down, oh<br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            (Knew it right there) so shame on me now (knew it right there)<br>
                            Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh!)<br>
                            Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
                            Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            <br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
                            Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
                            I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
