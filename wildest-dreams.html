                            He said, "Let's get out of this town<br>
                            Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"<br>
                            I thought Heaven can't help me now<br>
                            Nothing lasts forever<br>
                            But this is gonna take me down<br>
                            <br>
                            He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
                            He's so bad, but he does it so well<br>
                            I can see the end as it begins<br>
                            My one condition is<br>
                            <br>
                            Say you'll remember me<br>
                            Standing in a nice dress<br>
                            Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
                            Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
                            Say you'll see me again<br>
                            Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
                            Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
                            <br>
                            I said, "No one has to know what we do"<br>
                            His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room<br>
                            And his voice is a familiar sound<br>
                            Nothing lasts forever<br>
                            But this is getting good now<br>
                            <br>
                            He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
                            He's so bad, but he does it so well<br>
                            And when we've had our very last kiss<br>
                            My last request is<br>
