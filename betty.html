                            Betty, I won't make assumptions<br>
                            About why you switched your homeroom<br>
                            But I think it's 'cause of me<br>
                            Betty, one time, I was ridin' on my skateboard<br>
                            When I passed your house<br>
                            It's like I couldn't breathe<br>
                            <br>
                            You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
                            You can't believe a word she says most times<br>
                            But this time, it was true<br>
                            The worst thing that I ever did<br>
                            Was what I did to you<br>
                            <br>
                            But if I just showed up at your party<br>
                            Would you have me?<br>
                            Would you want me?<br>
                            Would you tell me to go fuck myself?<br>
                            Or lead me to the garden?<br>
                            In the garden, would you trust me<br>
                            If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
                            I'm only 17, I don't know anythin'<br>
                            But I know I miss you<br>
                            <br>
                            Betty, I know where it all went wrong<br>
                            Your favorite song was playin'<br>
                            From the far side of the gym<br>
                            I was nowhere to be found<br>
                            I hate the crowds, you know that<br>
                            Plus, I saw you dance with him<br>
                            <br>
                            You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
                            You can't believe a word she says most times<br>
                            But this time, it was true<br>
                            The worst thing that I ever did<br>
                            Was what I did to you<br>
                            <br>
                            But if I just showed up at your party<br>
                            Would you have me? Would you want me?<br>
                            Would you tell me to go fuck myself?<br>
                            Or lead me to the garden?<br>
                            In the garden, would you trust me<br>
                            If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
                            I'm only seventeen, I don't know anythin'<br>
                            But I know I miss you<br>
                            <br>
                            I was walkin' home on broken cobblestones<br>
                            Just thinkin' of you when she pulled up like<br>
                            A figment of my worst intentions<br>
                            She said "James, get in, let's drive"<br>
                            Those days turned into nights<br>
                            Slept next to her, but<br>
                            I dreamt of you all summer long<br>
                            <br>
                            Betty, I'm here on your doorstep<br>
                            And I planned it out for weeks now<br>
                            But it's finally sinkin' in<br>
                            Betty, right now is the last time<br>
                            I can dream about what happens when<br>
                            You see my face again<br>
                            <br>
                            The only thing I wanna do<br>
                            Is make it up to you<br>
                            So I showed up at your party<br>
                            Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
                            <br>
                            Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
                            Will you have me? Will you love me?<br>
                            Will you kiss me on the porch<br>
                            In front of all your stupid friends?<br>
                            If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?<br>
                            Will it patch your broken wings?<br>
                            I'm only 17, I don't know anythin'<br>
                            But I know I miss you<br>
                            <br>
                            Standin' in your cardigan<br>
                            Kissin' in my car again<br>
                            Stopped at a streetlight<br>
                            You know I miss you
