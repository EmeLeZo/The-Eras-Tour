                            You come and pick me up, no headlights<br>
                            Long drive<br>
                            Could end in burning flames or paradise<br>
                            <br>
                            Fade into view, oh<br>
                            It's been a while since I have even heard from you<br>
                            (Heard from you)<br>
                            <br>
                            I should just tell you to leave 'cause I<br>
                            Know exactly where it leads, but I<br>
                            Watch us go 'round and 'round each time<br>
                            <br>
                            You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
                            And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
                            And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
                            'Cause we never go out of style<br>
                            We never go out of style<br>
                            <br>
                            You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br>
                            And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br>
                            And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
                            'Cause we never go out of style<br>

                            So it goes<br>
                            He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm, mm<br>
                            Takes me home<br>
                            Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm yeah<br>
                            <br>
                            I say, "I heard, oh<br>
                            That you've been out and about with some other girl<br>
                            Some other girl"<br>
                            <br>
                            He says, "What you've heard is true, but I<br>
                            Can't stop thinking about you and I<br>
                            I said, "I've been there too a few times"<br>
