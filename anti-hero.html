                            I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser<br>
                            Midnights become my afternoons<br>
                            When my depression works the graveyard shift<br>
                            All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room<br>
                            <br>
                            I should not be left to my own devices<br>
                            They come with prices and vices<br>
                            I end up in crises<br>
                            Tale as old as time<br>
                            I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
                            One day I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
                            'Cause you got tired of my scheming<br>
                            For the last time<br>
                            <br>
                            It's me<br>
                            Hi!<br>
                            I'm the problem, it's me<br>
                            At teatime<br>
                            Everybody agrees<br>
                            I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
                            It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
                            <br>
                            Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby<br>
                            And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
                            Too big to hang out<br>
                            Slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
                            Pierced through the heart but never killed<br>
                            <br>
                            Did you hear my covert narcissism<br>
                            I disguise as altruism?<br>
                            Like some kind of congressman<br>
                            Tale as old as time<br>
                            I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
                            One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
                            And life will lose all its meaning<br>
                            For the last time<br>
                            <br>
                            It's me<br>
                            Hi!<br>

                            I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money<br>
                            She thinks I left them in the will<br>
                            The family gathers 'round and reads it<br>
                            And then someone screams out<br>
                            "She's laughing up at us from hell!"<br>
                            <br>
