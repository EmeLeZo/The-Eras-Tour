                            We gather here, we line up<br>
                            Weepin' in a sunlit room, and<br>
                            If I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes too<br>
                            Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe<br>
                            All the hell you gave me?<br>
                            'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you<br>
                            'Til my dying day<br>
                            <br>
                            I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
                            And you're the hero flying around, saving face<br>
                            And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?<br>
                            Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
                            Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
                            <br>
                            We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean<br>
                            Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring<br>
                            You know I didn't want to have to haunt you<br>
                            But what a ghostly scene<br>
                            You wear the same jewels that I gave you<br>
                            As you bury me<br>
                            <br>
                            I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
                            'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave<br>
                            And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?<br>
                            Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
                            Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
                            <br>
                            And I can go anywhere I want<br>
                            Anywhere I want, just not home<br>
                            And you can aim for my heart, go for blood<br>
                            But you would still miss me in your bones<br>
                            And I still talk to you (when I'm screaming at the sky)<br>
                            And when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)<br>
                            <br>
                            I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
                            And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves<br>
                            You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same<br>
                            Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
                            You turned into your worst fears<br>
                            <br>
                            And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain<br>
                            Crossing out the good years<br>
                            And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
                            Look at how my tears ricochet
