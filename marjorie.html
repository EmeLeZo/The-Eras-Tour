                            I'd think you were talking to me now<br>

                            You're alive, so alive<br>
                            <br>
                            Never be so polite<br>
                            You forget your power<br>
                            <br>
                            Never wield such power<br>

                            And if I didn't know better<br>
                            I'd think you were listening to me now<br>
                            If I didn't know better<br>
                            I'd think you were still around<br>

                            You're alive, you're alive in my head<br>

                            You're alive, so alive<br>
                            <br>
                            The autumn chill that wakes me up<br>
                            You loved the amber skies so much<br>
                            Long limbs and frozen swims<br>
                            You'd always go past where our feet could touch<br>
                            <br>
                            And I complained the whole way there<br>
                            The car ride back and up the stairs<br>
                            I should've asked you questions<br>
                            I should've asked you how to be<br>
                            <br>
                            Asked you to write it down for me<br>
                            Should've kept every grocery store receipt<br>
                            'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me<br>
                            Watched as you signed your name "Marjorie"<br>
                            All your closets of backlogged dreams<br>
                            And how you left them all to me<br>
                            <br>
                            What died didn't stay dead<br>
                            What died didn't stay dead<br>
                            You're alive, you're alive in my head<br>
                            What died didn't stay dead<br>
                            What died didn't stay dead<br>
                            You're alive, so alive<br>
                            <br>
                            And if I didn't know better<br>
                            I'd think you were singing to me now<br>

                            I'd think you were still around<br>
                            I know better<br>
                            But I still feel you all around<br>
                            I know better<br>
                            But you're still around
