                            I remember when we broke up the first time<br>
                            Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"<br>
                            'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month<br>
                            When you said you needed space<br>
                            What?<br>
                            <br>
                            Then you come around again and say<br>
                            "Baby, I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"<br>
                            Remember how that lasted for a day?<br>
                            I say, "I hate you", we break up, you call me, "I love you"<br>
                            <br>
                            Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
                            We called it off again last night but<br>
                            Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
                            This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you<br>
                            <br>
                            We are never, ever, ever getting back together<br>
                            We are never, ever, ever getting back together<br>
                            You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me<br>
                            But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together<br>
                            Like, ever<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm really gonna miss you picking fights<br>
                            And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right<br>
                            And you would hide away and find your peace of mind<br>
                            With some indie record that's much cooler than mine<br>
                            <br>
                            Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
                            You called me up again tonight but<br>
                            Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
                            This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you<br>

                            <br>
                            I used to think that we were forever, ever<br>
                            And I used to say, never say never<br>
                            Ugh, so he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you"<br>
                            And I'm like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting<br>
                            You know, like we are never getting back together<br>
                            Like, ever (no!)<br>
                            <br>
