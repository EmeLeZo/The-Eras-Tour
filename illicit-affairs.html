                            Make sure nobody sees you leave<br>
                            Hood over your head, keep your eyes down<br>
                            Tell your friends you're out for a run<br>
                            You'll be flushed when you return<br>
                            Take the road less traveled by<br>
                            Tell yourself you can always stop<br>
                            What started in beautiful rooms<br>
                            Ends with meetings in parking lots<br>
                            <br>
                            And that's the thing about illicit affairs<br>
                            And clandestine meetings and longing stares<br>
                            It's born from just one single glance<br>
                            But it dies, and it dies, and it dies<br>
                            A million little times<br>
                            <br>
                            Leave the perfume on the shelf<br>
                            That you picked out just for him<br>
                            So you leave no trace behind<br>
                            Like you don't even exist<br>
                            Take the words for what they are<br>
                            A dwindling, mercurial high<br>
                            A drug that only worked<br>
                            The first few hundred times<br>
                            <br>
                            And that's the thing about illicit affairs<br>
                            And clandestine meetings and stolen stares<br>
                            They show their truth one single time<br>
                            But they lie, and they lie, and they lie<br>
                            A million little times<br>
                            <br>
                            And you wanna scream<br>
                            Don't call me "kid"<br>
                            Don't call me "baby"<br>
                            Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me<br>
                            You showed me colors<br>
                            You know I can't see with anyone else<br>
                            <br>
                            Don't call me "kid"<br>
                            Don't call me "baby"<br>
                            Look at this idiotic fool that you made me<br>
                            You taught me a secret language<br>
                            I can't speak with anyone else<br>
                            <br>
                            And you know damn well<br>
                            For you, I would ruin myself<br>
                            A million little times
