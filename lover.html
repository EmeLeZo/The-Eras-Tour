                            We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January<br>
                            And this is our place, we make the rules<br>
                            And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear<br>
                            Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?<br>
                            <br>
                            Can I go where you go?<br>
                            Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                            And ah, take me out, and take me home<br>
                            You're my, my, my, my<br>
                            Lover<br>
                            <br>
                            We could let our friends crash in the living room<br>
                            This is our place, we make the call<br>
                            And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you<br>
                            I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all<br>
                            <br>
                            Can I go where you go?<br>
                            Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                            And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
                            You're my, my, my, my<br>
                            Lover<br>
                            <br>
                            Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?<br>
                            With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
                            I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover<br>
                            My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
                            All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
                            Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover<br>
                            And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me<br>
                            And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover<br>
                            <br>
                            Can I go where you go?<br>
                            Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                            And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
                            You're my, my, my, my<br>
                            Oh, you're my, my, my, my<br>
                            Darling, you're my, my, my, my<br>
