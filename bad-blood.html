                            You know it used to be mad love<br>
                            So take a look what you've done<br>
                            'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)<br>
                            Now we got problems<br>
                            And I don't think we can solve 'em<br>
                            You made a really deep cut<br>
                            And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)<br>
                            Did you have to do this?<br>
                            I was thinking that you could be trusted<br>
                            Did you have to ruin<br>
                            What was shining? Now it's all rusted<br>
                            Did you have to hit me<br>
                            Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe<br>
                            And rub it in so deep<br>
                            Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me<br>
                            Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times<br>
                            You and I<br>
                            'Cause baby, now we got bad blood<br>
                            You know it used to be mad love<br>

                            And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)<br>
                            Did you think we'd be fine?<br>
                            Still got scars on my back from your knife<br>
                            So don't think it's in the past<br>
                            These kind of wounds they last and they last<br>
                            Now did you think it all through?<br>
                            All these things will catch up to you<br>
                            And time can heal, but this won't<br>
                            So if you come in my way, just don't<br>
                            Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times<br>

                            You say sorry just for show<br>
