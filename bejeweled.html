                            Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind<br>
                            Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind<br>
                            In the shoes I gave you as a present<br>
                            Putting someone first only works<br>
                            When you're in their top 5<br>
                            And by the way<br>
                            I'm going out tonight<br>
                            <br>
                            Best believe I'm still bejeweled<br>
                            When I walk in the room<br>
                            I can still make the whole place shimmer<br>
                            And when I meet the band<br>
                            They ask, "Do you have a man?"<br>
                            I could still say, "I don't remember"<br>
                            Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
                            Don't put me in the basement<br>
                            When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
                            Diamonds in my eyes<br>
                            I polish up real<br>
                            I polish up real nice<br>
                            <br>
                            Nice!<br>
                            <br>
                            Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl<br>
                            (Too good of a girl)<br>
                            Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve<br>
                            I think it's time to teach some lessons<br>
                            I made you my world<br>
                            Have you heard<br>
                            I can reclaim the land<br>
                            And I miss you<br>
                            But I miss sparkling<br>
                            <br>
                            Best believe I'm still bejeweled<br>
                            When I walk in the room<br>

                            I could still say, "I don't remember"<br>

                            Don't put me in the basement<br>
                            When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>

                            Nice!<br>
                            <br>
                            Sapphire tears on my face<br>
                            Sadness became my whole sky<br>
                            But some guy said my aura's moonstone<br>
                            Just 'cause he was high<br>
                            And we're dancing all night<br>
                            And you can try<br>
                            To change my mind<br>
                            But you might have to wait in line<br>
                            What's a girl gonna do?<br>
                            A diamond's gotta shine<br>
                            <br>
