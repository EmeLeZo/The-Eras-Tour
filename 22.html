                            To dress up like hipsters<br>
                            And make fun of our exes<br>
                            Ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
                            It feels like a perfect night<br>
                            For breakfast at midnight<br>
                            To fall in love with strangers<br>
                            Ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
                            <br>
                            Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time<br>
                            It's miserable and magical, oh yeah<br>
                            Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines<br>
                            It's time, oh-oh<br>
                            <br>
                            I don't know about you<br>
                            But I'm feeling 22<br>
                            Everything will be alright if<br>
                            You keep me next to you<br>
                            <br>
                            You don't know about me<br>
                            But I'll bet you want to<br>
                            Everything will be alright if<br>
                            We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22<br>
                            <br>
                            It seems like one of those nights<br>
                            This place is too crowded<br>
                            Too many cool kids<br>
                            (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew) Ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
                            It seems like one of those nights<br>
                            We ditch the whole scene<br>
                            And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah<br>
                            <br>
                            We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way<br>
                            It's miserable and magical, oh yeah<br>
                            Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks<br>
                            It's time, oh-oh<br>
