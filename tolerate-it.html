                            I sit and watch you reading with your head low<br>
                            I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed<br>
                            I sit and watch you<br>
                            I notice everything you do or don't do<br>
                            You're so much older and wiser, and I<br>
                            <br>
                            I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
                            Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
                            Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
                            And watch you tolerate it<br>
                            If it's all in my head, tell me now<br>
                            Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
                            I know my love should be celebrated<br>
                            But you tolerate it<br>
                            <br>
                            I greet you with a battle hero's welcome<br>
                            I take your indiscretions all in good fun<br>
                            I sit and listen<br>
                            I polish plates until they gleam and glisten<br>
                            You're so much older and wiser, and I<br>
                            <br>
                            I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
                            Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
                            Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
                            And watch you tolerate it<br>
                            If it's all in my head, tell me now<br>
                            Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
                            I know my love should be celebrated<br>
                            But you tolerate it<br>
                            <br>
                            While you were out building other worlds, where was I?<br>
                            Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?<br>
                            I made you my temple, my mural, my sky<br>
                            Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life<br>
                            Drawing hearts in the byline<br>
                            Always taking up too much space or time<br>
                            You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I<br>
                            <br>
                            I break free and leave us in ruins?<br>
                            Took this dagger in me and removed it?<br>
                            Gain the weight of you then lose it<br>
                            Believe me, I could do it<br>
                            <br>
                            If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
                            Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
                            I know my love should be celebrated<br>
                            But you tolerate it<br>
                            <br>
                            I sit and watch you
