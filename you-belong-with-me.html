                            You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset<br>
                            She's going off about something that you said<br>
                            'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night<br>
                            I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like<br>
                            And she'll never know your story like I do<br>
                            <br>
                            But she wears short skirts<br>
                            I wear T-shirts<br>
                            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers<br>
                            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
                            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br>
                            <br>
                            If you could see that I'm the one<br>
                            Who understands you<br>
                            Been here all along<br>
                            So, why can't you see?<br>
                            You belong with me<br>
                            You belong with me<br>
                            <br>
                            Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans<br>
                            I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be<br>
                            Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself<br>
                            Hey, isn't this easy?<br>
                            <br>
                            And you've got a smile<br>
                            That can light up this whole town<br>
                            I haven't seen it in a while<br>
                            Since she brought you down<br>
                            You say you're fine, I know you better than that<br>
                            Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?<br>
                            <br>
                            She wears high heels<br>
                            I wear sneakers<br>
                            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers<br>
                            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
                            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br>
                            <br>
                            If you could see that I'm the one<br>
                            Who understands you<br>
                            Been here all along<br>
                            So, why can't you see?<br>
                            You belong with me<br>
                            <br>
                            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor<br>
                            All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
                            You belong with me<br>
                            You belong with me<br>
                            <br>
                            Oh, I remember you driving to my house<br>
                            In the middle of the night<br>
                            I'm the one who makes you laugh<br>
                            When you know you're 'bout to cry<br>
                            And I know your favorite songs<br>
                            And you tell me 'bout your dreams<br>
                            Think I know where you belong<br>
                            Think I know it's with me<br>
                            <br>
                            Can't you see that I'm the one<br>
                            Who understands you?<br>
                            Been here all along<br>
                            So, why can't you see?<br>
                            You belong with me<br>

                            Have you ever thought just maybe<br>
                            You belong with me?<br>
                            You belong with me
