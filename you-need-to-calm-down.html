                            You are somebody that I don't know<br>
                            But you're taking shots at me like it's PatrÃ³n<br>
                            And I'm just like "Damn, it's 7:00 a.m."<br>
                            Say it in the street, that's a knock-out<br>
                            But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out<br>
                            And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"<br>
                            <br>
                            And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression<br>
                            But I've learned the lesson that stressin'<br>
                            And obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun<br>
                            And snakes and stones never broke my bones so<br>
                            <br>
                            So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
                            You need to calm down<br>
                            You're being too loud<br>
                            And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)<br>
                            You need to just stop<br>
                            Like, can you just not step on my gown?<br>
                            You need to calm down<br>
                            <br>
                            You are somebody that we don't know<br>
                            But you're coming at my friends like a missile<br>
                            Why are you mad?<br>
                            When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)<br>
                            Sunshine on the street at the parade<br>
                            But you would rather be in the dark ages<br>
                            Making that sign, must've taken all night<br>
                            <br>
                            You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace<br>
                            And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate<br>
                            'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so<br>
                            <br>
                            So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
                            You need to calm down<br>
                            You're being too loud<br>
                            And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)<br>
                            You need to just stop<br>
                            Like, can you just not step on his gown?<br>
                            You need to calm down<br>
                            <br>
                            And we see you over there on the internet<br>
                            Comparing all the girls who are killing it<br>
                            But we figured you out<br>
                            We all know now, we all got crowns<br>
                            You need to calm down<br>
                            <br>
                            Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
                            You need to calm down (you need to calm down)<br>
                            You're being too loud (you're being too loud)<br>
                            And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)<br>
                            You need to just stop (can you stop?)<br>
                            Like, can you just not step on our gowns?<br>
