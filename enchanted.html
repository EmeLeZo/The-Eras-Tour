                            There I was again tonight<br>
                            Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
                            Same old tired, lonely place<br>
                            Walls of insincerity<br>
                            Shifting eyes and vacancy<br>
                            Vanished when I saw your face<br>
                            All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br>
                            <br>
                            Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"<br>
                            Across the room, your silhouette<br>
                            Starts to make its way to me<br>
                            The playful conversation starts<br>
                            Counter all your quick remarks<br>
                            Like passing notes in secrecy<br>
                            <br>
                            And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
                            All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you<br>
                            <br>
                            This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
                            I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
                            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
                            I was enchanted to meet you<br>
                            <br>
                            The lingering question kept me up<br>
                            2 a.m., who do you love?<br>
                            I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br>
                            And now I'm pacing back and forth<br>
                            Wishing you were at my door<br>
                            I'd open up and you would say<br>
                            Hey, it was enchanting to meet you<br>
                            All I know is I was enchanted to meet you<br>
                            <br>
                            This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
                            I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
                            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew...<br>
                            This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
                            I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
                            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
                            I was enchanted to meet you<br>
                            <br>
                            This is me praying that<br>
                            This was the very first page<br>
                            Not where the story line ends<br>
                            My thoughts will echo your name<br>
                            Until I see you again<br>
                            <br>
                            These are the words I held back<br>
                            As I was leaving too soon<br>
                            I was enchanted to meet you<br>
                            <br>
