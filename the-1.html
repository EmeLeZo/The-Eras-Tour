                            I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit<br>
                            Been saying "yes" instead of "no"<br>
                            I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though<br>
                            <br>
                            I hit the ground running each night<br>
                            I hit the Sunday matin√©e<br>
                            You know the greatest films of all time were never made<br>
                            <br>
                            I guess you never know, never know<br>
                            And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
                            And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
                            And it's alright now<br>
                            <br>
                            But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
                            Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
                            And if my wishes came true<br>
                            It would've been you<br>
                            In my defense, I have none<br>
                            For never leaving well enough alone<br>
                            But it would've been fun<br>
                            If you would've been the one<br>
                            (Ooh)<br>
                            <br>
                            I have this dream you're doing cool shit<br>
                            Having adventures on your own<br>
                            You meet some woman on the internet and take her home<br>
                            <br>
                            We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
                            But we were making it count<br>
                            You know the greatest loves of all time are over now<br>
                            <br>
                            I guess you never know, never know<br>
                            And it's another day waking up alone<br>
                            <br>
                            But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
                            Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
                            And if my wishes came true<br>
                            It would've been you<br>
                            In my defense, I have none<br>
                            For never leaving well enough alone<br>
                            But it would've been fun<br>
                            If you would've been the one<br>
                            <br>
                            I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br>
                            If one thing had been different<br>
                            Would everything be different today?<br>
                            <br>
                            We were something, don't you think so?<br>
                            Ros√© flowing with your chosen family<br>
                            And it would've been sweet<br>
                            If it could've been me<br>
                            In my defense, I have none<br>
                            For digging up the grave another time<br>
                            But it would've been fun<br>
                            If you would've been the one<br>
                            (Ooh)
