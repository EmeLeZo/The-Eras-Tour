                            Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man<br>
                            You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them<br>
                            Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie<br>
                            They say looks can kill and I might try<br>
                            I don't dress for women<br>
                            I don't dress for men<br>
                            Lately, I've been dressing for revenge<br>
                            <br>
                            I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends<br>
                            Don't get sad, get even<br>
                            So on the weekends<br>
                            I don't dress for friends<br>
                            Lately, I've been dressing for revenge<br>
                            <br>
                            She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some<br>
                            She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?<br>
                            Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride<br>
                            Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife<br>
                            And she looks so pretty<br>
                            Driving in your Benz<br>
                            Lately, she's been dressing for revenge<br>

                            Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI<br>
                            And I don't dress for villains<br>
                            Or for innocents<br>
