                            Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him<br>
                            Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted<br>
                            But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom<br>
                            Holdin' him for ransom<br>
                            <br>
                            Some, some boys are tryin' too hard<br>
                            He don't try at all, though<br>
                            Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so<br>
                            I see nothing better, I keep him forever<br>
                            Like a vendetta-ta<br>
                            <br>
                            I-I-I see how this is gon' go<br>
                            Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
                            I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
                            No one has to know<br>
                            <br>
                            In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
                            You should see the things we do, baby (mmm)<br>
                            In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
                            I know I'm gonna be with you<br>
                            So I'll take my time<br>
                            Are you ready for it?<br>
                            <br>
                            Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me<br>
                            Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry<br>
                            But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist<br>
                            And we'll move to an island, and<br>
                            <br>
                            And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor<br>
                            Every love I've known in comparison is a failure<br>
                            I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now<br>
                            Never be the same now, now<br>
                            <br>

                            In the middle of the night, in my dreams (eh)<br>
                            You should see the things we do (we do), baby<br>
