                            Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                            I'll be usin' for the rest of my life<br>
                            <br>
                            I've been breakin' hearts a long time<br>
                            And, toyin' with them older guys<br>
                            Just playthings for me to use<br>
                            Something happened for the first time<br>
                            In the darkest little paradise<br>
                            Shakin', pacin', I just need you<br>
                            <br>
                            For you, I would cross the line<br>
                            I would waste my time<br>
                            I would lose my mind<br>
                            They say, she's gone too far this time<br>
                            <br>
                            Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                            If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right<br>
                            Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                            I'll be usin' for the rest of my life<br>
                            <br>
                            Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                            If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right<br>
                            Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                            I'll be usin' for the rest of my life<br>
                            <br>
                            My name is whatever you decide, and<br>
                            I'm just gonna call you mine<br>
                            I'm insane, but I'm your baby<br>
                            (Your baby)<br>
                            Echoes (echoes), of your name inside my mind<br>
                            Halo, hiding my obsession<br>
                            I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy<br>
                            <br>
                            And baby, for you, I would fall from grace<br>
                            Just to touch your face<br>
                            If you walk away<br>
                            I'd beg you on my knees to stay<br>
                            <br>
                            Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
