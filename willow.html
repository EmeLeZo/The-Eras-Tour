                            I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
                            Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife<br>
                            And if it was an open-shut case<br>
                            I never would've known from that look on your face<br>
                            Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
                            <br>
                            The more that you say, the less I know<br>
                            Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
                            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                            Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
                            <br>
                            Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind<br>
                            Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneaking in<br>
                            As if you were a mythical thing<br>
                            Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
                            But there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
                            <br>
                            The more that you say, the less I know<br>
                            Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
                            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                            Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
                            You know that my train can take you home<br>
                            Anywhere else is hollow<br>
                            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                            Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
                            <br>
                            Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind<br>
                            They count me out time and time again<br>
                            Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind<br>
                            But I come back stronger than a '90's trend<br>
                            <br>
                            Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark<br>
                            Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
                            Now this is an open-shut case<br>
                            I guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
                            Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
                            <br>
                            The more that you say, the less I know<br>
                            Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
