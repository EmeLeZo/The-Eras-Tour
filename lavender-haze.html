                            <br>
                            Staring at the ceiling with you<br>
                            Oh, you don't ever say too much<br>
                            And you don't really read into<br>
                            My melancholia<br>
                            <br>
                            I've been under scrutiny (yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
                            You handle it beautifully (yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
                            All this shit is new to me (yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
                            <br>
                            I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me<br>
                            Surreal, I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say<br>
                            No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me<br>
                            I just wanna stay in that lavender haze<br>
                            <br>
                            All they keep asking me (all they keep asking me)<br>
                            Is if I'm gonna be your bride<br>
                            The only kinda girl they see (only kinda girl they see)<br>
                            Is a one night or a wife<br>
                            <br>
                            I find it dizzying (yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
                            They're bringing up my history (yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
                            But you weren't even listening (yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
                            Ooh, whoa-oh<br>
