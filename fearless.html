                            There's something about the way<br>
                            The street looks when it's just rained<br>
                            There's a glow off the pavement<br>
                            You walk me to the car<br>
                            And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there<br>
                            In the middle of the parking lot, yeah<br>
                            <br>
                            We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know<br>
                            I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now<br>
                            But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair<br>
                            Absentmindedly makin' me want you<br>
                            <br>
                            And I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
                            You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless<br>
                            And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
                            In a storm in my best dress, fearless<br>
                            <br>
                            So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road<br>
                            In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here<br>
                            In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me<br>
                            In this moment, now capture it, remember it<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
                            You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless<br>
                            And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
                            In a storm in my best dress, fearless<br>
                            <br>
                            Well, you stood there with me in the doorway<br>
                            My hands shake, I'm not usually this way<br>
                            But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave<br>
                            It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'<br>
                            It's fearless<br>
                            <br>
                            Oh yeah<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
                            You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless<br>
                            And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
