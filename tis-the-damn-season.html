                            If I wanted to know who you were hanging with<br>
                            While I was gone I would have asked you<br>
                            It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass<br>
                            But I felt it when I passed you<br>
                            There's an ache in you put there by the ache in me<br>
                            But if it's all the same to you<br>
                            It's the same to me<br>
                            <br>
                            So we could call it even<br>
                            You could call me babe for the weekend<br>
                            'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
                            I'm stayin' at my parents' house<br>
                            And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
                            And it always leads to you in my hometown<br>
                            <br>
                            I park–µd my car right between the Methodist<br>
                            And th–µ school that used to be ours<br>
                            The holidays linger like bad perfume<br>
                            You can run, but only so far<br>
                            I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave<br>
                            <br>
                            But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me<br>
                            <br>
                            We could call it even<br>
                            You could call me babe for the weekend<br>
                            'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
                            I'm stayin' at my parents' house<br>
                            And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
                            <br>
                            Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires<br>
                            Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out<br>
                            We could just ride around<br>
                            And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
                            And it always leads to you in my hometown<br>
                            <br>
                            Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake<br>
                            I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay<br>
                            So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends<br>
                            Who'll write books about me, if I ever make it<br>
                            And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'<br>
                            And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own<br>
                            <br>
                            To leave the warmest bed I've ever known<br>
                            We could call it even<br>
                            <br>
                            Even though I'm leavin'<br>
                            verse
                            And I'll be yours for the weekend<br>
                            'Tis the damn season<br>
                            <br>
