                            Combat<br>
                            I'm ready for combat<br>
                            I say I don't want that, but what if I do?<br>
                            'Cause cruelty wins in the movies<br>
                            I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you<br>
                            <br>
                            Easy they come, easy they go<br>
                            I jump from the train, I ride off alone<br>
                            I never grew up, it's getting so old<br>
                            Help me hold onto you<br>
                            <br>
                            I've been the archer<br>
                            I've been the prey<br>
                            Who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
                            But who could stay?<br>
                            <br>
                            Dark side<br>
                            I search for your dark side<br>
                            But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?<br>
                            And I cut off my nose just to spite my face<br>
                            Then hate my reflection, for years and years<br>
                            <br>
                            I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost<br>
                            The room is on fire, invisible smoke<br>
                            And all of my heroes die all alone<br>
                            Help me hold onto you<br>
                            <br>

                            I've been the prey<br>
                            Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
                            But who could stay?<br>
                            <br>
                            'Cause they see right through me<br>
                            They see right through me<br>
                            They see right through<br>
                            Can you see right through me?<br>
                            They see right through<br>
                            They see right through me<br>
                            I see right through me<br>
                            I see right through me<br>
                            <br>
                            All the king's horses and all the king's men<br>
                            Couldn't put me together again<br>
                            'Cause all of my enemies started out friends<br>
                            Help me hold onto you<br>
