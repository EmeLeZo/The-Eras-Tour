                            <br>
                            Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
                            You know that I caught it<br>
                            Bad, bad boy<br>
                            Shiny toy with a price<br>
                            You know that I bought it<br>
                            <br>
                            Killing me slow, out the window<br>
                            I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
                            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
                            What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br>
                            <br>
                            And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
                            It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
                            And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br>
                            It's a cruel summer<br>
                            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
                            No rules in breakable heaven<br>
                            But ooh, whoa oh<br>
                            It's a cruel summer<br>
                            With you<br>
                            <br>
                            Hang your head low<br>
                            In the glow of the vending machine<br>
                            I'm not dying<br>
                            You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
                            We're not trying<br>
                            <br>
                            So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
                            I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
                            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
                            And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br>
                            <br>
                            Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br>
                            It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
                            And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br>
                            It's a cruel summer<br>
                            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
                            No rules in breakable heaven<br>
                            But ooh, whoa, oh<br>
                            It's a cruel summer<br>
                            With you<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
                            And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
                            Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true<br>
                            I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
                            And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
                            Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
                            And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br>
                            "I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br>
                            He looks up grinning like a devil<br>
                            <br>
                            It's new, the shape of your body<br>
                            It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
                            And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br>
                            It's a cruel summer<br>
                            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
                            No rules, in breakable heaven<br>
                            But ooh, whoa, oh<br>
                            It's a cruel summer<br>
