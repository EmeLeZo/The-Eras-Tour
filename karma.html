                            You're talking shit for the hell of it<br>
                            Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant<br>
                            You're terrified to look down<br>
                            'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare<br>
                            Of everyone you burned just to get there<br>
                            It's coming back around<br>
                            <br>
                            And I keep my side of the street clean<br>
                            You wouldn't know what I mean<br>
                            <br>

                            Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend<br>
                            Karma's a relaxing thought<br>
                            Aren't you envious that for you it's not?<br>
                            Sweet like honey, karma is a cat<br>
                            Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me<br>
                            Flexing like a goddamn acrobat<br>
                            Me and karma vibe like that<br>

                            My pennies made your crown<br>
                            Trick me once, trick me twice<br>
                            Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?<br>
                            It's coming back around<br>
                            <br>

                            Ask me what I earned from all those tears<br>
                            Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here<br>
                            (I'm still, I'm still here)<br>
