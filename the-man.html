                            I would be complex<br>
                            I would be cool<br>
                            They'd say I played the Ô¨Åeld before I found someone to commit to<br>
                            And that would be ok<br>
                            For me to do<br>
                            Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you<br>
                            <br>
                            I'd be a fearless leader<br>
                            I'd be an alpha type<br>
                            When everyone believes ya<br>
                            What's that like?<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
                            Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
                            If I was a man<br>
                            And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
                            'Cause if I was a man<br>
                            Then I'd be the man<br>
                            I'd be the man<br>
                            I'd be the man<br>
                            <br>
                            They'd say I hustled<br>
                            Put in the work<br>
                            They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve<br>
                            What I was wearing<br>
                            If I was rude<br>
                            Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?<br>
                            <br>
                            And they would toast to me, oh<br>
                            Let the players play<br>
                            I'd be just like Leo<br>
                            In Saint-Tropez<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
                            Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
                            If I was a man<br>
                            And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
                            'Cause if I was a man<br>
                            Then I'd be the man<br>
                            I'd be the man<br>
                            I'd be the man<br>
                            <br>
                            What's it like to brag about<br>
                            Raking in dollars<br>
                            And getting bitches and models<br>
                            And it's all good if you're bad<br>
                            And it's okay if you're mad<br>
                            If I was out Ô¨Çashing my dollars<br>
                            I'd be a bitch, not a baller<br>
                            They paint me out to be bad<br>
                            So it's okay that I'm mad<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
                            Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that)<br>
                            And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)<br>
                            'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man)<br>
                            Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)<br>
                            I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (as fast as I can)<br>
                            Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (hey)<br>
                            And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)<br>
                            'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man), then I'd be the man<br>
                            <br>
                            I'd be the man<br>
                            I'd be the man (oh)<br>
                            I'd be the man (yeah)<br>
                            I'd be the man (I'd be the man)<br>
                            <br>
                            If I was a man<br>
