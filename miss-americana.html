                            You know I adore you<br>
                            I'm crazier for you<br>
                            Than I was at 16<br>
                            Lost in a film scene<br>
                            Waving homecoming queens<br>
                            Marching band playing<br>
                            I'm lost in the lights<br>
                            <br>
                            American glory<br>
                            Faded before me<br>
                            Now I'm feeling hopeless<br>
                            Ripped up my prom dress<br>
                            Running through rose thorns<br>
                            I saw the scoreboard<br>
                            And ran for my life<br>
                            <br>
                            No cameras catch my pageant smile<br>
                            I counted days, I counted miles<br>
                            To see you there, to see you there<br>
                            It's been a long time coming, but<br>
                            <br>
                            It's you and me<br>
                            That's my whole world<br>
                            They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay)<br>
                            The whole school is rolling fake dice<br>
                            You play stupid games<br>
                            You win stupid prizes<br>
                            It's you and me<br>
                            There's nothing like this<br>
                            Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)<br>
                            We're so sad, we paint the town blue<br>
                            Voted most likely to run away with you<br>
                            <br>
                            My team is losing<br>
                            Battered and bruising<br>
                            I see the high fives<br>
                            Between the bad guys<br>
                            Leave with my head hung<br>
                            You are the only one<br>
                            Who seems to care<br>
                            <br>
                            American stories<br>
                            Burning before me<br>
                            I'm feeling helpless<br>
                            The damsels are depressed<br>
                            Boys will be boys then<br>
                            Where are the wise men?<br>
                            Darling, I'm scared<br>
                            <br>
                            No cameras catch my muffled cries<br>
                            I counted days, I counted miles<br>
                            To see you there, to see you there<br>
                            And now the storm is coming, but<br>
                            <br>
                            It's you and me<br>
